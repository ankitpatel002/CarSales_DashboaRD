# Car Sales Dashboard

## Background
Our company operates as a car dealership, offering a variety of car models to our customers. To effectively monitor and analyze our sales performance, we require a comprehensive Car Sales Dashboard in Power BI.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to design and develop a dynamic and interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard aims to visualize critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to our car sales, facilitating data-driven decision-making and providing insights into our sales performance over time.

## Problem Statement 1: KPIs Requirement
The dashboard should offer real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) associated with our sales data. This will empower us to make informed decisions, track our progress, and identify trends and growth opportunities.

### Sales Overview
- Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales
- Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales
- Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales
- Difference between YTD Sales and Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) Sales

### Average Price Analysis
- YTD Average Price
- MTD Average Price
- YOY Growth in Average Price
- Difference between YTD Average Price and PTYD Average Price

### Cars Sold Metrics
- YTD Cars Sold
- MTD Cars Sold
- YOY Growth in Cars Sold
- Difference between YTD Cars Sold and PTYD Cars Sold

## Problem Statement 2: Charts Requirement
The dashboard requires various charts to effectively visualize sales data and trends.

- **YTD Sales Weekly Trend**: Display a line chart illustrating the weekly trend of YTD sales. The X-axis should represent weeks, and the Y-axis should show the total sales amount.
- **YTD Total Sales by Body Style**: Visualize the distribution of YTD total sales across different car body styles using a Pie chart.
- **YTD Total Sales by Color**: Present the contribution of various car colors to the YTD total sales through a pie chart.
- **YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region**: Showcase the YTD sales data based on different dealer regions using a map chart to visualize the sales distribution geographically.
- **Company-Wise Sales Trend in Grid Form**: Provide a tabular grid that displays the sales trend for each company. The grid should showcase the company name along with their YTD sales figures.
- **Details Grid Showing All Car Sales Information**: Create a detailed grid that presents all relevant information for each car sale, including car model, body style, color, sales amount, dealer region, date, etc.

By addressing these requirements, the Car Sales Dashboard will serve as a valuable tool for monitoring and analyzing our sales performance, enabling us to make informed decisions and drive business growth.
